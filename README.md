The objective of this study is to create accurate predicting model for loan default. Accurate loan default prediction can be beneficial for the financial industry's stability, profitability, and responsible lending practices. It benefits both lenders and borrowers while also contributing to the overall health of the economy. For creating the prediction model, 3 methods were selected such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Decision tree. Models were created using those 3 methods and then the models were evaluated. Then cross validation is done to assess the effectiveness and robustness of the models. K fold cross validation is used in here. Random forest model is selected as the best performed model. Finally, important factors which have impact for loan default were selected using Random Forest. According to the study, interest rate, annual income, dti and revol balance have the highest impact on loan default.
